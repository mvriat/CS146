Problem 1:
1) n^3 because the exponential 3 will always grow faster than 2.
2) n^2 log(n) is bigger because in n(log(n))^10, you can just bring down the 10
   using logarithmic rules and it just becomes 10n(log(n)). So n^2 > 10n.
3) 2^sqrt(n) is bigger. You can plot them on the graph and simply remember sqrt
   will always be larger.
4) 2^(2n) is bigger because you can just compare n and 2n and see that 2n > n.

Problem 2)
1) Best Case: O(1) because if n is even it will take one comparison.
2) Worst Case: Theta(sqrt(n))
3) Average Case: O(n)
