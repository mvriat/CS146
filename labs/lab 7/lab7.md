In this lab, we use the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm.
First we created the 2D array which we can fill. We first filled the diagonal with 0 since there is no path from a node to the same node.
After this we can use the input array to fill ours. It is undirected.
Now we implement the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
