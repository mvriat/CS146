In my program I checked whether the string is lenghth 0 and if it is I will return 0. After this I created a variable called duplicount. This holds the number of letters that have more than one occurence. The hash set here is going to hold letters as we iterate and at the end it will only contain letters with odd occurences. So we iterate through s, and if the hashset already has this letter then it's going to remove it and increment dupliCount since this means we found another instance of a letter. Otherwise, if it is a new letter we will add it to the hashset(we won't remove it until we find a duplicate).
Now at the end, we're going to check if the set is empty. If yes, this means that we have a perfectly even amount of letters and duplicates. So the palindrome will work as the string will be perfectly mirrored. Otherwise, if there is anything in count, this means there were lone letters with no dupicates. Even if there are more than one lone letters, you can only pick one of those letters to be in the palindrome, so this would be 2*duplicount + 1. yay!
