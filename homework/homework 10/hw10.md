I initially wanted to try this out in a recursive formant since we're kind of just doing the same thing over again, printing the root, its left child then right child, then that left childs left child, then its right child, and so on (you get the point). I got a little lost because if I just did print root then left and right child and called it again recursively, it would do something similar to depth first search. This is why I went with an iterative approach, as follows. First you want to check whether the root is null so that you can return an empty array list. Then create a list to store the results for each level. Here we then use a queue to store the nodes that we have checked/visited and perform breadth first search. While the queue isn't empty, create another list with the size of the queue to store the actual node values of the current level. You iterate throughout the queue and remove the nodes (dequeue) you visited and add its value to the levels list. After that you enqueue their children. Lastly, add that level to the level list and return it!
