First we had to check whether the image input was valid. So just return image if it's empty, if either of the rows or columns are empty, if the coordinates are less than 0, or out of bounds. Then it checks if the number you chose is already the color you want. Now that that's out of the way, we use a helper method to do the real work.
The helper method will do some validity checks as well and then turn the coordinate you want into the new color. Then we make coordinate directions so that we can change the colors of all those as well. Boom
I also used a method to print out the 2d array nicely.
