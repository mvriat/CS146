The way I decided to code this was using Kruskal's algorithm for MST of all the houses. Here we put the wells together with the pipes array so we can just focus on the costs of either the wells or pipes. We add the values for the wells at then end, then we sort it using the costs. Here we then iterate over the array we just sorted to check if they have different parent nodes, and if they do, we connect them and update the total cost. The find method is a helper method that finds the parent node given the house.
